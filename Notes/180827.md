## In ref to stretch

Not sure what needs to be done here.. My guess is grab all the problemset from hackerrank .. the easy one and then use it for the purpose solving the basic python functions.

I just realized, what if I am to build a dictionary of some words and related python functions.

Now - once, the processor hits this word, we just copy paste the function there, and run the program.

I'll start by word .. then sentense and eventually description.

e.g.

Take an input -> input()
Convert to integer -> int()
accept an array -> input().split(' ') .. and so on ..

I can take help from the documentation itself. Every function - very clearly has its own purpose stated. It will allow us to compare the instructions with the doc, and find appropriate function in future.
