# Blocker on how to identify the data structures in given question?

The temperory solution to this problem is to use the mapping. And then just to identify the type of the literal, use regex.
    e.g.
        second      -> 2
        half        -> 0.5
        one third   -> 0.33

The solution may seem very laborious and trivial too, but it is the most simplest one and might work for few initial works.
