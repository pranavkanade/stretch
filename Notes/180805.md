# The results from NLP parser

I've tested with following question : 
1. [mark has a share of three point four five percent in a company worth $500. How much money he must have invested?](https://explosion.ai/demos/displacy?text=mark%20has%20a%20share%20of%20three%20point%20four%20five%20percent%20in%20a%20company%20worth%20%24500.%20How%20much%20money%20he%20must%20have%20invested%3F&model=en_core_web_sm&cpu=1&cph=0)


also take a look at :
1. https://explosion.ai/demos/sense2vec
2. https://nlu.rasa.com/
3. For words to numbers :
    a. https://www.dcode.fr/writing-words-numbers
    b. http://code.activestate.com/recipes/550818-words-to-numbers-english/ (src code)
    c. https://pypi.org/project/word2number/
    d. https://www.npmjs.com/package/words-to-numbers

PS : look for `spacy and js` there is blog about it which talks about how to get started and build a bot

## Today :

* If python does not provide any thing to convert words to numbers, then I m left with two options.
    1. I should build my own algo for it using ML -> It'll be fun and great way to start this project.
    2. I could use npm package which will save time.
    3. I think first one is great option. I just need to find the dataset for it.
