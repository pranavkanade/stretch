# What are the minimum requirements

## Requirement 1 - Processing the instructions in natural language and preserving the DATA
I think, datastructure should be implemented to which will be used in conjugation to the instructions provided. First the data will be captured from the instructions and will be replaced by the ids for each one of them. This ensures that the instructions get translated to the programs and data remains unaffected. Once the output is ready, then, a simple parser will be used to replace the original values.

## Requirement 2 - Programming Language
The question here is - What my programming language should be able to do for the initial draft of the tool? I think, just to start it should only be able to `print` things. Mainly because it presents an opportunity where, I would be able to write a sequence to sequence model, and get the output.

## Requirement 3 - Pretrained network
Need to get the pretrained model which has been put to use before.

## Unaddressed -
* Working with data structures in neural networks - This presents solution of how the actual data from the question will be passed to the program. This might be possible with mapping. [Look at this link](http://localwww.math.unipd.it/~sperduti/PAPERI/)
